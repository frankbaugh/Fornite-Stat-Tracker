# Fornite-Stat-Tracker
this is based off of noobcodes1137's guide, with aims to build a more fleshed out version
back-end uses nodejs, expressjs mostly.




short term goals:

add information such as kills, k/d, winrate for each category(solos, duos, squads)//

change the way dom is manipulated from some ugly jQuery to more nice things (like what?)//

refine ui with js libraries such as granim.js and particles.js//

refine ui with css//



long term goals:
move application to angular.js//

launch into the real world//
